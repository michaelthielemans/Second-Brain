## Job Roles in the SOC
### Tier 1: alert analyst
These professionals monitor incoming alerts, verify that a true incident has occurred, and forward tickets to Tier 2, if necessary.
### Tier 2: incident responder
These professionals are responsible for deep investigation of incidents and advise remediation or action to be taken.
### Tier 3: Threat Hunter
These professionals have expert-level skill in network, endpoint, threat intelligence, and malware reverse engineering. They are experts at tracing the processes of the malware to determine its impact and how it can be removed. They are also deeply involved in hunting for potential threats and implementing threat detection tools. Threat hunters search for cyber threats that are present in the network but have not yet been detected.
