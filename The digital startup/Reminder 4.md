You can explain the 3 phases in the iterative testing process:
	1. Hypotheses
	2. Experiments
	3. Evidence

You can explain what a business hypothesis is:
	• Derived from your value proposition, business model or environment
	• An assumption that your value proposition or business model builds on
	• Knowledge needed to understand if your business idea might work

3 characteristics of a good business hypothesis:
1. Testable, is het testbaar? Het bewijsmateriaal bevestigd - successvol of niet
	- example: We believe millennial parents prefer STEM science project kits that match their children’s education level
2. Precise, definieer het wat , hoe en wanneer , hoe ziet success er uit
	- We believe millennial parents with kids aged 5-9 will pay €15 a month for STEM science project kits that match their children’s education level.
3. Discrete, er wordt enkel 1 element getest
	- We believe we can purchase science project materials at wholesale for less than €3 a kit. We believe we can ship science project materials domestically for less than €5 a kit (€15 - €3 - €5 = €7)

You can turn an incorrect hypothesis into a testable, precise and discrete hypothesis

You can organise hypotheses in 3 types (feasibility, desirability, viability):
	**1. Desirability**: do customers want it?
	**2. Feasibility**: can we deliver it?
	**3. Viability**: can we earn more money than we spend?

3 types hypotheses:
een geloof waarin je wil beweren dat je product of service:
- mogelijk is om te verwezelijken
- gewild is, er is vraag naar
- het kan iets opbrengen

You can map the different hypothesis types to the Business Model Canvas and you can list the associated blocks:

You can draw and explain the hypotheses Assumptions Map

You are able to prioritize assumptions for a specific business case

You can list and explain the characteristics of a good experiment
	A good experiment consists out of four components:
	1. Hypothesis
	2. Experiment
	3. Metrics
	4. Criteria

You can explain how experiments should be selected
	Start with discovery experiments
	• Gain first insights
	• Generate weak evidence
	• Are sufficient to discover if general direction is right
	Continue with validation experiments
	• Confirm insights
	• Generate stronger evidence
	• Required to validate the direction which was taken

1. You can explain what discovery experiments are
	**Exploration**: customer interview, a day in the life, discovery survey…
	**Data analysis**: search trend analysis, web traffic analysis, discussion forums…
	**Interest discovery**: fake (online) ad, fake email or social media campaign…
	**Non tangible prototypes**: mockups, storyboard, brochure, explainer video…
	**Preference & prioritization discovery**: product box…

You can explain what validation experiments are:
	**Call to action**: simple landing page, crowdfunding, pre-sale…
	**Minimum Viable Product:** prototypes (3D/Digital/Paper/…)
	**Simulation**: Mock sale, Wizard of Oz, pop-up store, free samples, …

You can give an example of a discovery experiment and explain it:
- web traffic analysis
- discussion forums

You can give an example of a validation experiment and explain it
- pop-up store
- crowdfunding

You can explain the difference between weak and strong evidence
	- Weak evidence includes opinions ("I would...", "I think..."), what people say in interviews or surveys (which might differ from what they actually do), small investments (like email sign-ups), and data gathered in lab settings where participants are aware they are being tested.
	- Strong evidence is based on facts and events ("Last week I...", "I spent..."). It includes what people do (observable behavior), large investments (like pre-purchasing a product or risking professional reputation), and observations from real-world settings where people are unaware they are being tested. Strong evidence is generally a better predictor of future behavior.

You can explain what evidence confidence level is
	The evidence confidence level indicates how much you believe the evidence gathered is strong enough to support or refute a specific hypothesis. It is determined by three dimensions:
	- the type and strength of evidence
	- the number of data points collected per experiment
	- and the number and type of experiments conducted for the same hypothesis
