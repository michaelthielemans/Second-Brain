Why you should fill out a Value Proposition Design Canvas first and only then the Business Model Canvas.
- The process of developing a business idea starts with understanding the customer. The Value Proposition Canvas is a tool for generating powerful business ideas by first understanding the customer in detail, then designing a value proposition that addresses their needs.

You can explain what is meant by 'FREE as a business model', recognize this type of business model and give an example:
- "FREE as a business model" means that at least one substantial customer segment can continuously benefit from a free-of-charge offer. These non-paying customers are typically financed by another part of the business model or by a different customer segment. Examples include Freemium, advertising-based models, bait and hook, and open source. An example from the sources is Google, which offers free services (like web search) and generates revenue from advertisers.

You can explain what is meant by 'freemium' and give an example
- 'Freemium' Explanation and Example Freemium is a type of "FREE as a business model" where a basic product or service is offered for free, while premium features or services are offered for a fee. This model aims to convert a small base of free users into paying users. The cost structure includes platform costs for both free and paid users, with revenue streams coming from both free (cost €0) and paid conversions.

You can explain what is meant by ‘bait and hook’ and give an example
- 'Bait and Hook' refers to a business model characterized by an attractive, often free or inexpensive, initial offer that encourages continuous future purchases of related products or services. The customer is "locked in" by the initial bait, and the recurring revenue comes from the "hook". A classic example provided is Gillette, where the inexpensive "razor handle" is the bait, and the frequent replacement "blades" are the hook that generates recurring revenue.

You can explain what is meant by 'Multi-sided platforms', recognize this type of business model and give an example.
-  Bring together two or more distinct but interdependent groups of customers. The platform creates value by facilitating interactions between these different groups. A key characteristic is the "Network effect," where the value of the platform increases as more users from each customer group join, leading to a positive feedback loop of growth. These platforms often dominate mature industries due to fierce competition and the ability to leverage higher margins for R&D or price reduction. Examples given include Airbnb, Uber, Visa, Udemy, Steam, and Instagram. LinkedIn and Google are also highlighted as multi-sided platforms.

You can explain what is meant by 'The long tail', recognize this type of business model and give an example
- selling less of more

You can explain what is meant by 'Unbundling business models', recognize this type of business model and give an example
- 'Unbundling business models' suggests that there are three fundamentally different types of businesses that historically co-exist within single corporations, but are ideally unbundled into separate entities due to their different economic, competitive, and cultural imperatives. These three types are:

	1. Customer Relationship Business: Focuses on finding and building relationships with customers, highly service-oriented, aiming to gain large "wallet share" and achieve economies of scope.

	2. Product Innovation Business: Focuses on inventing new products/services and bringing them to market, attracting highly skilled knowledge workers, with speed being key.

	3. Infrastructure Business: Focuses on building and managing facilities for high-volume, repetitive operational tasks (e.g., logistics, manufacturing), cost-focused, and striving for efficiency and economies of scale. The source illustrates this with the example of the mobile telecom industry, where companies might unbundle into distinct entities focusing on customer relationships (e.g., mobile carriers strong on branding and customer retention), infrastructure (e.g., outsourcing network operations to equipment manufacturers for lower costs), and product innovation (e.g., collaborating with smaller creative firms for new technologies and content).
