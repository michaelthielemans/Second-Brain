show ip protocols | include router id

change the router id
router-id 1.1.1.1
reset the ospf process in order to load the new router id setting
`clear ip osp process`

`(conf-router)#network xxxx xxxx`
this sets the interface active so it sends hello packets AND also the network is added to the ospf database
