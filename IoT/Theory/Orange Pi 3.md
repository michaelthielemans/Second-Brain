## Orange PI software- [[Orange pi packages]]

Max current on a GPIO is 15mA !!!!

### Enable the hardware PWM on the orange PI
Note: for this you need also a special library in your code..

**To enable the PWM mode on the PINS:**

•sudo nano /boot/orangepiEnv.txt
	• overlays=pwm
	•Not practical due to the lack of library's
