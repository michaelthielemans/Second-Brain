### Hard PWM
The duty cycle is controlled by dedicated hardware.
-> is fast and precise , but requires expensive hardware
##### Enable the hardware PWM on the orange PI
Note: for this you need also a special library in your code..
**To enable the PWM mode on the PINS:**

•sudo nano /boot/orangepiEnv.txt
	• overlays=pwm
	•Not practical due to the lack of library's

### Soft PWM
Duty cycle is generated by software running on a microcontroller or microprocessor
-> is slower and less precise but easy to implement

With the wiringPI library you can also do PWM on the GPIO pins.
