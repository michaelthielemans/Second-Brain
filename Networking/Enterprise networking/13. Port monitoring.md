## RSPAN Remote span
port mirroring on a remote device

# Configure SPAN on a switch
```
s1(conf)#monitor session 1 source interface <interface_id> both|in|..
s1(conf)#monitor session 1 destination interface <interface_id>
```

```
show monitoring 1

# Configure RSPAN Remote span
In order to be able to send and receive port monitoring from a remote device you have to define the source ports on that remote device where you than put it onto a remote vlan.
from the destination device you can pull that traffic from the dedicated vlan.

## Putting source traffic on a dedicated remote VLAN
This has to be configured on the remote device!

1. configure a dedicated VLAN for the SPAN `Switch1(conf)# vlan 99`
2. enable remote span on the vlan ` Switch1(config-vlan)# remote-span`
3. Create a monitor sessions and define the source `Switch1(config)# monitor session 2 source interfaces gig0/1`
4. Add the dedicated vlan to the monitor sessions: `Switch1(config)# monitor session 2 destination remote vlan 99`
5. 

## Pulling the traffic from the dedicated remote VLAN
This has to be configured on the local device where you want to connect you monitoring software.

1.  configure a dedicated VLAN for RPAN
2. create a monitoring session to get span from the dedicated vlan as a source  `switch1(config)# monitor session 2 source remote vlan 99
3. define the destination port:  `switch1(config)# monitor session 2 destination `
