# Topologies
WANs are implemented using the following logical topology designs:

•Point-to-Point Topology
•Hub-and-Spoke Topology
•Dual-homed Topology
•Fully Meshed Topology
•Partially Meshed Topology

# WAN OSI Layers
Wan protocols focus on layer 1 and layer 2 

|Layer 1 Protocols |
|--|
|Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH)|
|Synchronous Optical Networking (SONET) |
|Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM)|

|Layer 2 Protocols|
|--|
|Broadband (i.e., DSL and Cable)|
|Wireless|
|Ethernet WAN (Metro Ethernet)|
|Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)|
|Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) (less used)|
|High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC) (less used)|
|Frame Relay (legacy)|
|Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) (legacy)|
