# Network transmissions quality
## Types of delay
>- fixed delay
>- variable delay
>- jitter = varitations in delay between packets


|**Delay**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|Code delay|The fixed amount of time it takes to compress data at the source before transmitting to the first internetworking device, usually a switch.|
|Packetization delay|The fixed time it takes to encapsulate a packet with all the necessary header information.|
|Queuing delay|The variable amount of time a frame or packet waits to be transmitted on the link.|
|Serialization delay|The fixed amount of time it takes to transmit a frame onto the wire.|
|Propagation delay|The variable amount of time it takes for the frame to travel between the source and destination.|
|De-jitter delay|The fixed amount of time it takes to buffer a flow of packets and then send them out in evenly spaced intervals.|

### Playout Delay Buffer Compensates for Jitter


# Traffic characteristics of voice,video,data

## Voice traffic

The voice sampling packets are evenly spread over time all having the same size.

| Voice Traffic Characteristics | One-Way Requirements |  |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| - Smooth<br>- Benign/goedaardig<br>- Drop sensitive<br>- Delay sensitive<br>- UDP priority | - Latency ≤ 150ms<br>- Jitter ≤ 30ms<br>- Loss ≤ 1% Bandwidth (30 - 128 Kbps) |  |

## Video traffic
UDP ports such as 554, are used for the Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP)

|Video Traffic Characteristics|One-Way Requirements|
|---|---|
|- Bursty<br>- Greedy<br>- Drop sensitive<br>- Delay sensitive<br>- UDP priority|- Latency ≤ 200-400 ms<br>- Jitter ≤ 30-50 ms<br>- Loss ≤ 0.1**-**1%<br>- Bandwidth (384 Kbps - > 20 Mbps|   |

## Data traffic

|Data Traffic Characteristics|
|---|
|- Smooth/bursty<br>- Benign and greedy<br>- Drop insensitive<br>- Delay insensitive<br>- TCP retransmits|

### Quality of Experience or QoE
- Does the data come from an interactive application?
- Is the data mission critical?
### Factors to Consider for Data Delay

|**Factor**|**Mission Critical**|**Not Mission Critical**|
|---|---|---|
|Interactive|Prioritize for the lowest delay of all data traffic and strive for a 1 to 2 second response time.|Applications could benefit from lower delay.|
|Not interactive|Delay can vary greatly as long as the necessary minimum bandwidth is supplied.|Gets any leftover bandwidth after all voice, video, and other data application needs are met.|

# Queuing algorithms

## First-In, First-Out (FIFO)

when used:
- when there is no congestion
- fasted method
## Weighted Fair Queuing (WFQ)

- does not allow classification of traffic
- automated scheduling method
- classifies traffic by packer header addressing
- traffic comes is -> is evaluated -> put in the queue (if it has a high priority then it is placed in front of the queue)
- there is only one queue

#### It weighs the traffic and gives it a priority:
- High
- medium
- normal
- low
#### Header addressing:
> - source and destination IP addresses
> - MAC addresses
> - port numbers
> - protocol
> - Type of Service (ToS) value

#### Limitations
- NOT supported with tunneling and encryption because these features modify the packet content information required by WFQ for classification.
- Although WFQ automatically adapts to changing network traffic conditions, it does not offer the degree of precise control over bandwidth allocation that CBWFQ offers.
##  Class-Based Weighted Fair Queuing (CBWFQ)

-  Extends the standard WFQ functionality to provide support for **user-defined** traffic classes

##### Define traffic classes based on match criteria including:
>- protocols
>- access control lists (ACLs)
>- input interfaces

##### Create classes and add characteristics to the class like:
>- bandwidth
>- weight
>- maximum packet limit>

>[!error] Each class has it own FIFO queue!
> When the queue of the class reaches the packet limit, tail drop will occur.
## Low Latency Queuing (LLQ)

It allows to strictly prioritise Real-time traffic above all other traffic! It is mainly intended for voice traffic(because it requires low jitter/delay)

A PQ (priority Queuing) is added on top of CBWFQ

# QoS Techniques
## avoid packet loss
- increase link capacity
- increase buffer size to accommodate bursts
- drop lower priority packets in advance
	-> WRED (weighted random early detection) -> starts dropping packets before congestion occurs.
