## Network baseline
> A network baseline is used to establish normal network performance to determine the “personality” of a network under normal conditions.

#### The baseline data is as follows:
>•Provides insight into whether the current network design can meet business requirements.
>•Can reveal areas of congestion or areas in the network that are underutilized.

#### When capturing data for analysis, the period specified should be:
> •At a minimum, seven days long.
> •Last no more than six weeks, unless specific long-term trends need to be measured.
> •Generally, a two-to-four-week baseline is adequate.


# Troubleshooting methods

|  |  |
| ---- | ---- |
| Bottom-Up | Good approach when the problem is suspected to be a physical one. |
| Top-Down | Approach for simpler problems, when you think the problem is with a piece of software. |
| Divide-and-Conquer | Start at a middle layer (i.e, Layer 3) and tests in both directions from that layer. |
| Follow-the-Path | Used to discover the actual traffic path from source to destination to reduce the scope of troubleshooting. |
| Substitution | You physically swap a suspected problematic device with a known, working one. |
| Comparison | Attempts to resolve the problem by comparing a nonoperational element with the working one. |
| Educated guess | Success of this method varies based on your troubleshooting experience and ability. |
