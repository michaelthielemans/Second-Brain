# Hierarchical networks
•Converged network traffic
•Critical applications
•Diverse business needs
•Centralized administrative control

# Borderless Switched Networks
> network architecture that can connect anyone, anywhere, anytime, on any device

>•Borderless switched networks are hierarchical, modular, resilient, and flexible.

## Tree Tier network
1. core layer
	The core layer is the network backbone and connects several layers of the network.
	The core layer provides fault isolation and high-speed backbone connectivity.
2. Distribution layer
	The distribution layer implements routing, quality of service, and security.
	It aggregates large-scale wiring closet networks and limits Layer 2 broadcast domains.
	Distribution layer switches connect to access layer and core layer switches.
3. Access layer
	The access layer provide network access to the user.

Access layer switches connect to distribution layer switches
## Two Tier network

1. core + distribution layer => collapsed core
2. acces layer

# Scalable networks:
> network that can grow without losing availability and reliability.
