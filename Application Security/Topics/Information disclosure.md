When a website unintentionally reveals sensitive information to its users. Depending on the context, websites may leak all kinds of information to a potential attacker, including:

- Data about other users, such as usernames or financial information
- Sensitive commercial or business data
- Technical details about the website and its infrastructure

The dangers of leaking sensitive user or business data are fairly obvious, but disclosing technical information can sometimes be just as serious. Although some of this information will be of limited use, it can potentially be a starting point for exposing an additional attack surface, which may contain other interesting vulnerabilities. The knowledge that you are able to gather could even provide the missing piece of the puzzle when trying to construct complex, high-severity attacks.

Occasionally, sensitive information might be carelessly leaked to users who are simply browsing the website in a normal fashion. More commonly, however, an attacker needs to elicit the information disclosure by interacting with the website in unexpected or malicious ways. They will then carefully study the website's responses to try and identify interesting behavior.

### Examples of information disclosure

- Revealing the names of hidden directories, their structure, and their contents via a `robots.txt` file or directory listing
- Providing access to source code files via temporary backups 
- Explicitly mentioning database table or column names in error messages
- Unnecessarily exposing highly sensitive information, such as credit card details
- Hard-coding API keys, IP addresses, database credentials, and so on in the source code
- Hinting at the existence or absence of resources, usernames, and so on via subtle differences in application behavior
## How do information disclosure vulnerabilities arise?

- **Failure to remove internal content from public content**. For example, developer comments in markup are sometimes visible to users in the production environment.
- **Insecure configuration of the website and related technologies**. For example, failing to disable debugging and diagnostic features can sometimes provide attackers with useful tools to help them obtain sensitive information. Default configurations can also leave websites vulnerable, for example, by displaying overly verbose error messages.
- **Flawed design and behavior of the application**. For example, if a website returns distinct responses when different error states occur, this can also allow attackers to [enumerate sensitive data](https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/password-based#username-enumeration), such as valid user credentials.

## How to test for information disclosure vulnerabilities
#### Fuzzing

If you identify interesting parameters, you can try submitting unexpected data types and specially crafted fuzz strings to see what effect this has. Pay close attention; although responses sometimes explicitly disclose interesting information, they can also hint at the application's behavior more subtly. For example, this could be a slight difference in the time taken to process the request. Even if the content of an error message doesn't disclose anything, sometimes the fact that one error case was encountered instead of another one is useful information in itself.

You can automate much of this process using tools such as Burp Intruder. This provides several benefits. Most notably, you can:

- Add payload positions to parameters and use pre-built wordlists of fuzz strings to test a high volume of different inputs in quick succession.
- Easily identify differences in responses by comparing HTTP status codes, response times, lengths, and so on.
- Use grep matching rules to quickly identify occurrences of keywords, such as `error`, `invalid`, `SELECT`, `SQL`, and so on.
- Apply grep extraction rules to extract and compare the content of interesting items within responses.

You can also use the [Logger++](https://portswigger.net/bappstore/470b7057b86f41c396a97903377f3d81) extension, available from the BApp store. In addition to logging requests and responses from all of Burp's tools, it allows you to define advanced filters for highlighting interesting entries. This is just one of the many Burp extensions that can help you find any sensitive data that is leaked by the website.
#### Search

You can use this tool to look for any expression within the selected item. You can fine-tune the results using various advanced search options, such as regex search or negative search. This is useful for quickly finding occurrences (or absences) of specific keywords of interest.

#### Find comments

You can use this tool to quickly extract any developer comments found in the selected item. It also provides tabs to instantly access the HTTP request/response cycle in which each comment was found.

#### Discover content

You can use this tool to identify additional content and functionality that is not linked from the website's visible content. This can be useful for finding additional directories and files that won't necessarily appear in the site map automatically.

### Engineering informative responses

Verbose error messages can sometimes disclose interesting information while you go about your normal testing workflow. However, by studying the way error messages change according to your input, you can take this one step further. In some cases, you will be able to manipulate the website in order to extract arbitrary data via an error message.

There are numerous methods for doing this depending on the particular scenario you encounter. One common example is to make the application logic attempt an invalid action on a specific item of data. For example, submitting an invalid parameter value might lead to a stack trace or debug response that contains interesting details. You can sometimes cause error messages to disclose the value of your desired data in the response
## How to prevent information disclosure vulnerabilities

Preventing information disclosure completely is tricky due to the huge variety of ways in which it can occur. However, there are some general best practices that you can follow to minimize the risk of these kinds of vulnerability creeping into your own websites.

- Make sure that everyone involved in producing the website is fully aware of what information is considered sensitive. Sometimes seemingly harmless information can be much more useful to an attacker than people realize. Highlighting these dangers can help make sure that sensitive information is handled more securely in general by your organization.
- Audit any code for potential information disclosure as part of your QA or build processes. It should be relatively easy to automate some of the associated tasks, such as stripping developer comments.
- Use generic error messages as much as possible. Don't provide attackers with clues about application behavior unnecessarily.
- Double-check that any debugging or diagnostic features are disabled in the production environment.
- Make sure you fully understand the configuration settings, and security implications, of any third-party technology that you implement. Take the time to investigate and disable any features and settings that you don't actually need.
