### Vertical access controls

Are mechanisms that restrict access to sensitive ==functionality to specific types of users==.

With vertical access controls, different types of users have access to different application functions. For example, an administrator might be able to modify or delete any user's account, while an ordinary user has no access to these actions. Vertical access controls can be more fine-grained implementations of security models designed to enforce business policies such as separation of duties and least privilege.

### Horizontal access controls

Horizontal access controls are mechanisms that restrict ==access to resources to specific users==.

With horizontal access controls, different users have access to a subset of resources of the same type. For example, a banking application will allow a user to view transactions and make payments from their own accounts, but not the accounts of any other user.Â 

### Context-dependent access controls

Context-dependent access controls restrict access to functionality and resources based upon the state of the application or the user's interaction with it.

Context-dependent access controls prevent a ==user performing actions in the wrong order==. For example, a retail website might prevent users from modifying the contents of their shopping cart after they have made payment.
